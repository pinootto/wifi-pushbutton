# wifi-pushbutton

At present the hardware is a WeMos D1 mini (ESP8266-16F).

The firmware uses Arduino libraries.

The software is written in python and implements a web service for sending messages to wechat accounts (both individuals and groups).

The web service can also be triggered by cron, in addition to the wifi-pushbotton.
